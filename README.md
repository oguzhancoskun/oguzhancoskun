# Hey, I'm Oguzhan 👋

I'm a DevOps & Cloud Engineer who loves building things that run fast, scale well, and (hopefully) never wake me up at 3 AM 🚀.  
Most of my playground is AWS, but I also speak fluent Python, Golang, and Bash.

I’ve been in tech for over a decade — from automating messy deployments to designing cloud architectures for fintech, e-commerce, and travel tech companies.  
These days, I run my own consultancy **Nsource** in London, helping teams modernize infrastructure, improve delivery pipelines, and adopt automation-first culture.

## What I work with
- ☁️ AWS, Kubernetes, Docker  
- 🛠 Terraform, CloudFormation, CDK  
- ⚡ CI/CD with GitHub Actions, GitLab, Jenkins  
- 📊 Monitoring with Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch  
- 🧩 Python, Golang, Bash  
- 🔐 Security & networking best practices

## Outside the terminal
When I’m not writing code or wrangling infrastructure, you’ll probably find me:
- ♟ playing chess
- 🍳 experimenting in the kitchen
- 📚 diving into philosophy
- 🔧 tinkering with Raspberry Pi & IoT projects
