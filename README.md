# Oguzhan Coskun

AWS Certified Solutions Architect, Serverless Expert, DevOps Engineer, and Python & Golang enthusiast.

I'm an AWS Certified Solutions Architect and experienced DevOps & Cloud Engineer with over 12 years of hands-on experience delivering scalable, secure, and automated infrastructure solutions across various industries.

Currently, I run a London-based consultancy (Nsource), offering contract-based DevOps and cloud architecture services. I primarily work with clients in fintech, e-commerce, and travel tech, helping them modernize infrastructure, implement best practices, and accelerate delivery. While self-employed, I'm also open to permanent roles where I can contribute long-term and grow within a strong engineering culture.

My core expertise includes:

Cloud Platforms: AWS (EC2, Lambda, VPC, CloudHSM, hybrid & on-premise)
Infrastructure as Code: Terraform, CloudFormation, CDK
DevOps & CI/CD: GitLab, GitHub Actions, Jenkins
Containers & Orchestration: Kubernetes, Docker
Monitoring & Observability: Prometheus, CloudWatch, Grafana, Nagios, Icinga
Programming: Python, Golang, Bash scripting
Configuration Management: Ansible, Chef, Puppet, SaltStack
Security & Compliance: PCI-DSS, IAM, networking best practices
Beyond my professional work, I regularly write technical articles on Medium and enjoy hands-on projects involving IoT and DIY using Raspberry Pi and other hardware platforms. I'm also an active chess player and passionate about cooking and philosophy, hobbies that enrich my strategic thinking and creativity.

I thrive in cross-functional teams, enjoy simplifying complex problems, and believe in automation-first engineering to build reliable, efficient systems.

Open to collaboration, contracts, or full-time opportunities — let’s connect.
